Insight is what data-vis practitioner should provide to the audience.
Data itself doesn't give you any insight and even if one could get its own insight out of the data, taking so much time to abstract the insight everytime is time-consuming and sometimes leads the analyst to the wrong direction. Data visualizer is one who analyzes data and drive the potential readers to the direction that data visualizer thinks that it's the essence of the strings of data.

People shoud learn what all the data is indicating rather than purely grounding on the factual thing. Data is telling a message and that's what people should learn from the data. However the processed data sometimes causes a bias. That's why data auditing is necessary. Even if superficially data is cleary guiding you to a certain direction, verification of the data if the core idea that the visualization or raw data is biased due to the collection method or interpretation method is necessary to be reviewed. Crwod data auditing enables it by being hinted by crowd funding. This idea is a good example borrowing a mechanism from the other field and implement into another field and having a meaning.

Chart Junk is what data visualization pracitioner should avoid. Information is not a joke. Rather it is a serious thing to be delivered to the audience. Sometimes how the data is represented affects the angle how audiences take the data set. Therefore, unncessary part of even called 'junk' part should be dealt with properly not to make any misunderstanding on the intent. Otherwise, as the speaker mentioned, the data might be seen as 'not serious'data or even worst case a falsy data.
Therefore handling junk part and managing the overall visulization into a proper and'serious'way is a very crucial step.
